# LKR-USD-Exchange-Rates-Prediction
In this project, deep learning techniques were utilized to model and predict the LKR/USD exchange rates for Sri Lanka spanning from 2010-May to 2024-Feb. Leveraging Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks, a predictive model was built capable of capturing complex temporal patterns in the exchange rate data.


## Key Techniques Used:

- LSTM Neural Networks: Employed LSTM architecture to effectively capture long-term dependencies in time series data, crucial for accurate exchange rate forecasting.
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE) Loss: Utilized MAE loss function for training the model, optimizing it to minimize the absolute differences between predicted and actual exchange rates.
- Adam Optimizer: Employed the Adam optimizer to efficiently update model weights during training, enhancing convergence and overall performance.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluated model performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), providing insights into prediction accuracy.


## Results and Insights:

Successfully trained the model on historical exchange rate data, achieving significant predictive capability for future LKR/USD exchange rates in Sri Lanka.
The trained model demonstrates its potential in forecasting currency fluctuations, offering valuable insights for financial planning and risk management.
Through meticulous analysis and optimization, I ensured the model's robustness and reliability, contributing to its effectiveness in real-world applications.
