# LKR-USD-Exchange-Rates-Prediction
In this project, deep learning techniques were utilized to model and predict the LKR/USD exchange rates for Sri Lanka spanning from 2010-May to 2024-Feb. Leveraging Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks, a predictive model was built capable of capturing complex temporal patterns in the exchange rate data.
